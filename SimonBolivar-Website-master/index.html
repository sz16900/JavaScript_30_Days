      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Prelude, 1807–1810</strong>
          <p>Bolívar returned to Venezuela in 1807. After a coup on 19 April 1810, Venezuela achieved de facto
            independence
            when the Supreme Junta of Caracas was established and the colonial administrators deposed. The Supreme Junta
            sent a delegation to Great Britain to get British recognition and aid. This delegation presided by Bolívar
            also included two future Venezuelan notables Andrés Bello and Luis López Méndez. The trio met with Francisco
            de Miranda and persuaded him to return to his native land.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>First Republic of Venezuela, 1811–1812</strong>
          <p>In 1811, a delegation from the Supreme Junta, also including Bolívar, and a crowd of commoners
            enthusiastically received Miranda in La Guaira.[17] During the insurgence war conducted by Miranda, Bolívar
            was promoted to colonel and was made commandant of Puerto Cabello the following year, 1812. As Royalist
            Frigate Captain Domingo de Monteverde was advancing into republican territory from the west, Bolívar lost
            control of San Felipe Castle along with its ammunition stores on 30 June 1812. Bolívar then retreated to his
            estate in San Mateo.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Second Republic of Venezuela (1813–1814) and exile</strong>
          <p>This was the beginning of the Admirable Campaign. On 24 May, Bolívar entered Mérida, where he was
            proclaimed
            El Libertador ("The Liberator").[20] This was followed by the occupation of Trujillo on 9 June. Six days
            later, and as a result of Spanish massacres on independence supporters, Bolívar dictated his famous "Decree
            of
            War to the Death", allowing the killing of any Spaniard not actively supporting independence. Caracas was
            retaken on 6 August 1813, and Bolívar was ratified as El Libertador, establishing the Second Republic of
            Venezuela. The following year, because of the rebellion of José Tomás Boves and the fall of the republic,
            Bolívar returned to New Granada, where he commanded a force for the United Provinces.</p>
